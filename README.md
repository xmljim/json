# JSON-Library

Yet another JSON Library. This one is an evolution of a very early version of a JSON library I wrote
back with Java 6 and have slowly and incrementally upgraded and refactored over time.

Now it's using Java 17, taking advantage of numerous features from Java 9 and onward, including
implementing a fully modular library.
